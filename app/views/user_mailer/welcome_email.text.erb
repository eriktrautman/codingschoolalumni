Welcome, <%= @user.fname %>!


You're now signed up for the Coding School Alumni Association.


Our last event, a talk about scaling early startups, was on 2/18 at New Relic in San Francisco and Jeremy's slides are available at slid.es  (http://slid.es/jeremyruppel/hi-jeremy-what-do-you-know-about-startups").


We've got the power of a large group of amazing people behind us and can use it to pull together some pretty exciting stuff: speakers, networking, education, hackathons, kickball teams... you name it, you got it.  And that includes more than just San Francisco stuff.


So if you've got ideas or would like to get involved and help organize or contribute in any way, please let me know at erik@theodinproject.com.  

We're also working to build a simple but useful alumni portal to replace the signup page you used to get this far.  It's an agile open-source project that could be great experience for you so please reach out if you'd like to help out.


I can't wait to see you out at our next event!


Sincerely,

Erik Trautman
President, CSAA

Welcome, <%= @user.fname %>!


You're now signed up for the Coding School Alumni Association.


  Our next event is on Tuesday February 18th at New Relic in San Francisco.  The theme is how to scale a simple web app into a "real" tech company... sort of like the jump you made (or will soon make) from learning to build basic CRUD apps in school to working at a company with a giant and fully scaled mess of a code base.  Sign up for that (free) at http://csaa-winter-2014.eventbrite.com.


A question: What would you do with hundreds of fun, smart and motivated fellow former bootcampers?


We've got the power of a large group of amazing people behind us and can use it to pull together some pretty exciting stuff: speakers, networking, education, hackathons, kickball teams... you name it, you got it.  And that includes more than just San Francisco stuff.


So if you've got ideas or would like to get involved and help organize or contribute in any way, please let me know at erik@theodinproject.com.


I can't wait to see you out at our next event!


Sincerely,

Erik Trautman
President, CSAA

Welcome, <%= @user.fname %>!


You're now signed up for the Coding School Alumni Association.


We had our kickoff last November and we'll be getting together again for another event in late February so I hope you can make it!  Stay tuned for details.  


A question: What would you do with hundreds of fun, smart and motivated fellow former bootcampers?


We've got the power of a large group of amazing people behind us and can use it to pull together some pretty exciting stuff: speakers, networking, education, hackathons, kickball teams... you name it, you got it.  And that includes more than just San Francisco stuff.


So if you've got ideas or would like to get involved and help organize or contribute in any way, please let me know at erik@theodinproject.com.


I can't wait to see you out at our next event!


Sincerely,

Erik Trautman
President, CSAA
